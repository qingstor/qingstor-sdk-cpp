secret_access_key: 'SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_EXAMPLE'
```
### Usage

Now you are ready to code. You can read the detailed guides in the list below to have a clear understanding.
If you are programing with C++ language, we recommend you to use the modern C++ interface and read `Usage Guide for QingStor C++ style interface`.
And if you are programing with C language, you should chose the C style interface and read `Usage Guide for QingStor  style interface`.
